`dioxus-logger` is a (planned-to-be) feature-rich logger that uses the `log` crate to provide a standard interface for all your logging needs.

**Current & Planned Features**
- [x] stdio logging (Web, Desktop) - Mobile to come
- [ ] Sending logs over HTTP to an API
- [ ] Logging to a file
- [ ] Timestamps 
- [ ] Custom log format
- [ ] Feature flags for faster compilation

**This library is under development. Expect breaking changes.**

```rust, ignore
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use log::{LevelFilter, info};

fn main() {
  dioxus_logger::init(LevelFilter::Info).expect("failed to init logger");
  dioxus::web::launch(app);
}

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
  info!("app component rendered!");
  rsx!(cx, p { "Hello, Dioxus!" })
}
```

## Platform Support
Dioxus Logger is supported on every platform that Dioxus supports! There are a few advanced features that will only work on a couple of targets. 
Specifically the HTTP logging and filesystem logging will not work on mobile targets.

## Installation
You can add `dioxus-logger` to your application by adding it to your dependencies.
```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus-logger = { version = "x.x.x", features = ["stdio"] }
```
